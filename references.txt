This project works on the web version. For the android version I simply get a "Undefined is not a function" error that I can't solve.
The issue might be related to the react-navigation, but it didn't seem to work, no matter what I tried. Even changing the dependencies didn't fix it.
I have knowledge and experience with both react and react-native, but I've neve faced this problem. 
Anyway, I'm very happy with the result I got, specially with the color changing for each pokemon (even though it is kinda slow and I wanted softer colors).
